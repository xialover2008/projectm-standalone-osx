PROJECTM README FILE
--------------------------------

QUICK OVERVIEW
----------------------
projectM started initially as a reimplementation of the Win32/DirectX based music visualizer Milkdrop under Linux/SDL/OpenGl/XMMS. 
It currently supports up to Milkdrop 1.04b presets, but there are some bugs with certain presets containing 1.04 features This project
is 100% GPL'ed - feel free to use the code for whatever. 

WARNING
------------------------
This is a beta release. There some known bugs, and likely unknown ones. 
Please report bugs at the project web page at source forge: http://xmms-projectm.sourceforge.net

INSTALL
------------------------

]1] Install SDL 1.3 branch

(Un)fortunately there is a special feature in a development branch of SDL dubbed "branch_1_3_x" that projectM requires to handle
different texture sizes and window resizing. This code is under CVS at SDL's sourceforge site, and has not been thoroughly
tested. However, the developers have found it stable enough to merit installation. We provide a source tarball of a recent 
CVS version on our website (http://xmms-projectm.sourceforge.net). 


Once you have downloaded the tarball SDL-1.3.0.tar.gz do the following:

As usual, run

sh> ./configure

followed by

sh> make

and as root

sh> make install

NOTE: this will install SDL in /usr/local, so when you compile projectM make sure that it finds SDL-1.3 and
not SDL-1.2 (which is likely in /usr with most distributions). Hopefully the configure script will verify this
automatically for you. To force SDL into /usr, type 

./configure --prefix=/usr

followed by typical make and make install.

[2] Install projectM

If you haven't already, download the latest tarball release from http://xmms-projectm.sourceforge.net.

Then run

sh> ./configure

followed by

sh> make

and as root

sh> make install

This will install projectM into XMMS's Visualization plugin directory. projectM's configuration
files, including the default packaged presets are in /etc/projectM.

Enable projectM by loading XMMS and pressing CTRL-v. This will bring up the vis plugin menu. Highlight
projectM in the list (if it's not there something went wrong during installation), and click the enable
button. Sit back and enjoy the trippy visuals...
