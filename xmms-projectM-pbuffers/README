PROJECTM README FILE
--------------------------------

QUICK OVERVIEW
----------------------
projectM started initially as a reimplementation of the Win32/DirectX based music visualizer Milkdrop under Linux/SDL/OpenGl/XMMS. 
It currently supports up to Milkdrop 1.04b presets, but there are some bugs with certain presets containing 1.04 features This project
is 100% GPL'ed - feel free to use the code for whatever. 

INSTALL
----------------------------

[1] Install libprojectM

[2] Install xmms-projectM-pbuffers

If you haven't already, download the latest tarball release from http://xmms-projectm.sourceforge.net.

Then run

sh> ./configure

followed by

sh> make

and as root

sh> make install

This will install projectM into XMMS's Visualization plugin directory. projectM's configuration
files, including the default packaged presets are in $prefix/share/projectM.

Enable projectM by loading XMMS and pressing CTRL-v. This will bring up the vis plugin menu. Highlight
projectM in the list (if it's not there something went wrong during installation), and click the enable
button. Sit back and enjoy the trippy visuals...

CONFIGURE
----------

edit ~/.projectM/config
